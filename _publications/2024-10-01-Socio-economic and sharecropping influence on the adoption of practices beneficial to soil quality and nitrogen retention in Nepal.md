excerpt: The paper examines the determinants of adopting soil-friendly agricultural practices. It focuses on sharecropping influence on adoption of practices. Being a sharecropper is associated with low adoption of some and high adoption of other practices. Sharecroppers mostly do not adopt minimum tillage and fertiliser incorporation. Contrary to assertions, adoption is more context-dependent than uniformly hindered by contract.
