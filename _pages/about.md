I’m a Ph.D. student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State University, using satellite imagery to detect cyanobacteria in the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound. My research enhances North Carolina’s ability to predict and respond to harmful algal blooms, especially in underserved rural and low-income communities with limited water monitoring. By combining satellite and ground data, I aim to improve early warning systems, protect public health, and guide smarter environmental decisions. My interests focus on applying geospatial tools to environmental and security challenges
